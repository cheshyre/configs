# Introduction

This repository details my configurations for my entire setup. The goal is for me to be able to use this repository to quickly and easily set up the tools and configurations for me to be comfortable on a new setup. This was written relative to a fresh Ubuntu install, but it should realistically easily translate to Debian and Arch as I differ to other repos and websites for specific install instructions. Some technologies and configurations can also probably be cherry-picked for an OSX setup. However, I doubt one can fully replicate my setup on OSX.

# Initial Cleanup

# Non-Configured Tools

# Configured Tools

These are the tools that I have additional configurations for. Instructions on how to set them up can be found in their READMEs in each of their respective directories. The hyperlinks below take you to the relevant README.

## Graphical User Interface

- [i3](i3) - a minimalistic tiling window manager that I have taken a liking to
- [compton](compton) - a compositor to prevent screen tearing since i3 is not a compositing window manager

## Command-Line Interface

- [bash](bash) - standard Unix shell with aliases

# Import/Export Script

I plan on writing a script to sync this repository with the configs on a specific setup. `import` will copy the local config files into the repo. `export` will set the local config files to be the same as the repo.

# Feedback

If you are using this and you find incomplete/unclear instructions, dead links, no configs where there realistically could be configs, or anything else, [open an issue](issues).
